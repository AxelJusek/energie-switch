# energie-switch
This small project was written out of desperation because i wanted to use a net-controllable power-socket and found no affordable and working solution for.

## The product chosen as solution
After a long search I ended up with this: https://www.energenie.com/item.aspx?id=7416 
The Energenie EG-PMS2-LAN&copy; was affordable for me and available. All that was missing was a software to use it.
In order not to violate anyones copyright, the name must not fit the original company but should give a hint to the used components.

## State of the project
This project lay dormant for a while and was hosted only on my private systems. I decided now to put it out into the wild, in the hope that it may be helpful and i find the time to update it to the state of the art and replace the german words with english ones. To get it out I had to do some very HOT-Fixes about the names, that may cause some refactoring troubles, please handle the code with extra care.

## Thanks 
Many thanks to Vitaly Sinilin. The project https://github.com/unterwulf/egctl gave me some valuable hints on how to implement the access to the switch. You may take a look at this if you are looking for a C-Implementation.
